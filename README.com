## 9) “Sale” / “sharing” of personal information (U.S. disclosures)

We do **not** sell personal information for money.

However, some privacy laws define “sale” or “sharing” broadly to include certain disclosures for **cross-context behavioral advertising** (e.g., retargeting via ad platforms). If those definitions apply, you may have the right to opt out of such “sharing.”

To request an opt-out, contact us at **contact@pslscout.com** and include “Opt out of targeted advertising” in the subject line. You can also reduce this type of sharing by adjusting cookie settings in your browser and ad preferences on third-party platforms.

## 10) International data transfers

We primarily operate in the **United States** and intend to process information in the U.S.

Some of our service providers may process or access information from other locations depending on their operations. Where this occurs, we take steps designed to ensure appropriate protections consistent with applicable law.
